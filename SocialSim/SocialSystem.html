     <h1>Simulating simple social systems [WIP]</h1>
     <h2>What does simplified model say about us?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="textsWide">
    For a while recently iv'e been pondering how societies work.
    Society seems to have a structure, but how can that happen
    if everyone acts on their own? What about people decides the structure as a whole?
    <br><br>
    Social systems are difficult to comprened. Close relationships to international politics,
    the real world is a complecated place, but what if we could make it simpler?
    What if we could compress all of human nature into one simple relationship?
    <br><br>
    This post I made is all about answering these questions and what we can learn from them.
  </div>
  <div class="Header">
    Part one- The network
  </div>
    <div class="ScrollSection" id="P1">
      <div class="texts" id="P1E1">
        My goal here is to create a network, that models the way we act.<br>
        Lets begin in the simplest place, were gonna need some people. Can't have interaction without people!
        <br><br>
        Click in the black void to add some red ball people.
        <br>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div class="texts" id="P1E2">
        We want our model to represent relationships, albeit very basicly and one dimentionaly. Lets show relations with a single like hate status.
        <br><br>
        A line conneting two people shows an opinion of one other, Bright green shows freindlyness, while red shows hate.
        <br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div class="texts"id="P1E3" >
        To make the structure of the model more apparent, lets add an other human quality, shunning off people you dislike while huddling with your friends.
        <br><br>
        People with green connections will now get together. A group hug!
        <br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div class="texts" id="P1E4" >
        This is our model, the skeleton, but it is missing one important thing, the interaction itself! The relationships are static, they never change.
        <br><br>
        Now this begs the question, how do people respond to the people and connections around them? How do we model this simply and fluidly?
        <br>
        <br>

  <div class="Header"id="thing2">
    Part two- The rule
  </div>
  <div class="ScrollSection" id="P2">
      <div class="texts" id="P2E1">
      Lets think for a moment about the small scale. For a single relationship, how should it change given the ones around it? Take a second to think about this.
      What situation would give us any insight on this?
      <br>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div class="texts" id="P2E2">
      Lets look at the case where there are three people, all with very intense emotions toards eachother. Imagine if a pair of people hated each other, while both liking the third guy. What is bound to happen?
      <br><br>
      What if all three people disliked eachother? How would you expect there groups to evolve?
      <br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div class="texts"id="P2E3" >
      From your experience you probrably know that this is how it progresses. People try to maintain clarity by making sure who their freinds and enemys are, its just human nature.
      <br><br>
      Any situation where some one can be enterpreted as friends and enemys are avoided, by shifting sides.
      <br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div class="texts"id="P2E4" >
      We can represent this property mathmaticaly/programatically.
      <button onclick="myFunction()">Click here to see how it works.</button>
      <div id="small">
      Looking at one persons connection to another gives one opinion. Person A likes person B so or so much.
      Another opinion can be deduced from a third person C. Person A has an connection to Person C,
      who also has an opinion of Person B. Multiply these together to get a deduced opinion.
      Think about it like this, C has an opinion about B, but A has an opinion of C's opinion.
      <br><br>
       Now given these two opinions, A will now change his opinion of B to more closey match the other.
      Remember, People don't like ambiguity so they will naturaly do this.
      Run this little algotithm on all trinagles of people to find the whole change.
      All this is represented by this single line of code:
      <br><br>
      this.NextRespect+= Com.Speed*(AC.Respect*BC.Respect- Math.abs(AC.Respect*BC.Respect) * this.Respect);
      <br><br>
      Did that make sense? Probrably not.
      </div>
      <br><br>
      With this, our model is complete. It is responsive and acts like a real community!
      Now we are ready to answer the questions that we first asked.
