       A perspective on matrix transformations

     We've all seen matricies before, those formidable grids of numbers.
     For lots they are shrowded in mystery, and something to do with Keanu reeves.
     Let's try to unsheath the actual meanings and uses.
     <div class="subtitle">
      What a matrix does-
    </div>
    As we know, the beast we call the matrix has many abilities, matrix
   multiplication, and addition. Let's take a look at multiplication to
   see what it really does. Multiplication between a matrix and a list of numbers of looks like this-
   <br><br>
    <img  id="MatrixEx" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \large" border="0"/>

    <p id="Matrix">
    for a list of <span  data-var="height"><span> values multiplied into a matrix
      with <span class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="height" data-min="1" data-max="5"> rows </span>
    and <b class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-var="width" data-min="1" data-max="5"> columns </b>
    </p>
     Unpacking this, a matrix seems like a nice way to represent a
     function where all the outputs are linear functions on the inputs.
     More particularly an A by B matrix takes a list of width A to one of
     width B. <br> Neat.
     <div class="subtitle">
      What a matrix looks like-
    </div>
      Let's try to see what the matrix does to lists of numbers, and what do we do with lists of numbers?
      Graph them! A list of two numbers can be described as points in 2D. Lets take a look at a graph of
      a few points, before and after their multiplied matrix-
      <canvas id="Matrix2d"> eh</canvas>
      <br><br>
      <img  id="2dMatrixText" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \large" border="0"/>
      <br><br>
      Mouse over the points to see their multiplication, and drag them around.
      <br><br>
      Interesting, it seems like the matrix transformed the whole frame. Why? This is because
      the matrix manipulated the basis vectors, the unit vectors in the x and y directions. Since
      all other are just linear combinations of these, it transforms all of space. In symbols it looks like this-
      <br><br>
      <img id="MatrixEx2" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \large
      \begin{bmatrix}a_{1}&amp; a_{2}\\ b_{1}&amp; b_{2}\\  \end{bmatrix}
      \times
      \begin{bmatrix} x\\y\end{bmatrix}=
      \begin{bmatrix}xa_{1} +ya_{2}\\xb_{1} +yb_{2}\\ \end{bmatrix}
      = x\times \begin{bmatrix} a_{1}\\b_{1}\end{bmatrix}+
      y\times \begin{bmatrix} a_{2}\\b_{2}\end{bmatrix}" border="0">
      <br><br>
      We call this kind of transformation a change of basis,
      and as we shown, is simply matrix multiplication. Let's look
      at how a general basis change affects points in space-
      <canvas id="MatrixBasis"> eh</canvas>
      <br><br>
      <img  id="BasisMatrixText" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \large" border="0"/>
      <br><br>
      Now you can drag the new basis vectors to move them.
