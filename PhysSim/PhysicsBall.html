			    <h2>How to program a simple collision system</h2>
			  </div>
			  <div class="texts">
			   Making a physics simulation is not as easy as I thought!
			    I spent months working on the code, 
			    just so I could get something functional.
			    I decided I wanted to share my "hard" work 
			    and guide you through how I made my code work.
			    <br><br>
			    Lets begin with the most basic things, the way our particle moves. Our particles have X and Y coordonates. I express them in the form of vectors.
			  </div>
			  <canvas id="Fig1" class="figs"> eh</canvas>
			  <div class="texts">
			    This doesnt tell us much our particle, we don't know where they are going.
			    We need to add a velocity and acceleration. Take a look at where the particle goes when you change the initial velocity and acceleration.
			  </div> 
			  <canvas id="Fig2" class="figs"> eh</canvas>
			  <div class="texts">
			    We have our first bit of code. We now have a class for our particle and a few functions. 
			    This code tells the computer how to move our particle in one unit of time. This code is running in your browser!
			  </div>
			  <div class="code">
			    this.Update=function(){//Update position, velocity and acceleration<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp this.Pos=this.NextPos();<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp this.Vel.set(Vadd(this.Vel,this.Acc));<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp this.Acc.set(this.Grav);<br>
			    }<br>
			    this.NextPos=function(){ //Change position by velocity and 1/2 acceleration<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp  return Vadd(this.Pos,Vadd(this.Vel,Vscale(this.Acc,0.5)));<br>
			    }
			  </div>
			   <div class="texts">
			    Now that we understand how our particle works, Lets get to the hard part, the collision. 
			    I began with the most simple solution. We say it collides when its above the line before it updates and underneath the line when after.
			     The simplest for of barrier is just a horisontal one. Try moving it around and changing some of its qualities.
			  </div>
			  <canvas id="Fig3" class="figs"> eh</canvas>
			  <div class="texts">
			    You might of noticed a few things about simulation above. This part for me was one of the roadblocks I ran into while trying to make this thing.<br>
			    <br>
			    Heres the faulty code that runs the simulation.
			  </div>
			  <div class="code">
			  if(Wall.Collides(Ball)){<br>
			  &nbsp&nbsp Wall.Bounce(Ball);<br>
			  }
			  </div>
			  <div class="code">
			    //This runs in the wall class<br>
			    this.Collides=function(B){//takes a ball object<br> 
			    &nbsp&nbsp var Cross= (B.Pos.y &lt this.Corner.y)&&(B.NextPos().y &gt this.Corner.y); //checks if it falls through<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp var Tween= (B.Pos.x &lt this.Corner.x)&&(B.Pos.x &gt this.Corner.x+this.length);<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp return Cross && Tween;<br>
			    }<br>
			    this.Bounce=function(B){<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp B.Vel.y*=-bounce;<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp B.Vel.x*=slide;<br>
			    }
			  </div>
			  <div class="texts">
			    Lets list out our problems-<br>
			    <ul>
			    <li>The physics doesn't work, the balls fall right through the line when the bounce coefficient is less than 1</li>
			    <li>The lines can only horisontal, I want the lines to work at all angles!</li>
			    </ul>
			    <br>
			    The solution for the first issue came to me when I realised I could do something simple. 
			    The code above has no issues, I was just missing one crucial thing. I needed to add a normal force to stop it from falling through.
			    <br><br> 
			    Here's what I added. (The particle becomes red when it gets stablised)
			  </div>
			  <div class="code">
			    if(Wall.Collides(Ball)){<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp Wall.Bounce(Ball);<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp if(Wall.Collides(Ball)){ //Check if it <i>still</i> falls through<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Wall.Stablise(Ball); //Set Acc.y and Vel.y to 0<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Ball.PaintRed();<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp }<br>
			    }
			  </div>

			    Thats better.
			    <br><br>
			    Now that thats solved lets move on to our next problem. Having it to work for the horisontal case was so easy,
			    if only we could rotate the whole frame to make a tilded one horisontal. It turns out you can actually do just that! 
			    <br><br>
			    There is actually a pair of functions that do this, vector multiplication and it's inverse, vector divison.
			    <br><br>
			    Look at the funcions below, find out how they work.
			  </div>
			  <canvas id="Fig5" class="figs"> eh</canvas>
			  <canvas id="Fig6" class="figs"> eh</canvas>
			   <div class="texts">
			     The first function returns the two vectors multiplied, which looks like one of them stacked on the other.
			      Imagine holding the point 0,0 in place and streching 
			     the point 0,1 to a specific vector by scaling and rotating space. If we see where an other vector gets 
			     dragged to, thats the result of multiplying them together. 
			     <br><br>
			     The second function is the inverse of the first, It takes a vector to the point 0,1, and sees how another gets dragged along with it.
			     <br><br>
			     This is the code-
			  </div>
			  <div class="code">
			    function Vmult(A,B){<br>
			    &nbsp &nbsp  return new vect(A.x*B.x-A.y*B.y,A.x*B.y+A.y*B.x);<br>
			    }<br>
			    <br>
			    function Vdiv(P,C){<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp  return new vect((C.x*P.x+C.y*P.y)/((C.x*C.x)+(C.y*C.y)),<br>
			    &nbsp&nbsp    (C.x*P.y-C.y*P.x)/((C.x*C.x)+(C.y*C.y)));<br>
			    }<br>
			  </div>
			  <div class="texts">
			    These functions are usefull because we can use the division one do take a specific vector to 1,0 ,making it horisontal.
			    Then we can multiply by the same vector to return it to its original state.
			    This allows us to use the code we already made for the horisontal case, for all cases.
			    <br><br>
			    Now we can make our barriers slanted. Lets add the vector that indicates the barrier length to the wall class.
			    The new code for the Collides ,Bounce and Stabilise functions look like this. 
			  </div>
			  <div class="code">
			  this.Collides=function(Ball){<br>
			    var Posr=Vdiv(Vadd(Ball.Pos,Vscale(Corner,-1)),Base); //Flattened Pos<br>
			    var Nextr=Vdiv(Vadd(Ball.NextPos(),Vscale(Corner,-1)),Base)//Flattened nextPos;<br>
			    var C1=((Posr.y&gt 0)&&(Nextr.y&lt 0));<br>
			    var C2=((Posr.y&lt0)&&(Nextr.y&gt 0));<br>
			    var C3=((Posr.y===0)&&(Nextr.y&lt 0));<br>
			    var C4=((Nextr.y===0)&&(Posr.y&gt 0));<br>
			    var C5=((Posr.y===0)&&(Nextr.y===0));<br>
			    var Tween=((Posr.x&gt=0)&&(Posr.x&lt =1))||((Nextr.x&gt =0)&&(Nextr.x&lt=1));<br>
			    return (C1||C2||C3||C4||C5)&&Tween;<br>
			  }<br>
			  this.Bounce=function(Ball){<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp var Rvel=Vdiv(Ball.Vel,Base);// Rotated Vel<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp var RAcc=Vdiv(Ball.Acc,Base);// Rotated Acc<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp Rvel.y*=-this.bounce;<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp Rvel.x*=this.slide;<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp Ball.Vel=Vmult(Rvel,Base);// Undo rotations<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp Ball.Acc=Vmult(RAcc,Base);<br>
			  }<br>
			  this.Stablise=function(Ball){<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp var RVel=Vdiv(Ball.Vel,Base);//Rotate frame<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp var RACc=Vdiv(Ball.Acc,Base);<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp RVel.y=0; //Stablise<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp RACc.y=0;<br>
			   &nbsp&nbsp Ball.Vel=Vmult(RVel,Base);//Undo rotation <br>  
			   &nbsp&nbsp Ball.Acc=Vx(RACc,Base); <br>
			  }
			  </div>
			  <div class="texts">
			  Heres what it looks like-
			  </div>
			  <canvas id="Fig7" class="figs"> eh</canvas>
			  <div class="texts">
			     And thats it, thats how the thing works, for the most part!
