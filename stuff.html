		   Making a physics simulation is not as easy as I thought!
		    I spent months working on the code, 
		    just so I could get something functional.
		    I decided I wanted to share my "hard" work 
		    and guide you through how my code works.

		    Lets begin with the most basic things, the way our particle moves. Our particles have X and Y coordonates. I express them in the form of vectors.

		    This doesnt tell us much our particle, we don't know where they are going.
		    We need to add a velocity and acceleration.

		    We have our first bit of code, setting up our particle class and telling us how to update the particle based of physics.

		    this.Update=function(){<br>
